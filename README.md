# mjml-http-server

A self-hosted alternative to the mjml API. Built with express.

The API is compatible with https://mjml.io/api in that it only exposes one
endpoint - `/v1/render`, but doesn't require authentication. You should probably
run this within your own private network.

#### Why?

You're writing an app in another language than Javascript and need to interop
with MJML. Instead of embedding NodeJS in your Python image you can call MJML
compilation over HTTP.

You can alternatively use the [MJML API](https://mjml.io/api), but it's
currently invite only and has privacy implications (do you want your emails to
be sent to yet another third party?).

For an elaborate discussion see: https://github.com/mjmlio/mjml/issues/340
